## Filing Bugs

If you're experiencing behavior that appears to be a bug in RStudio, you're welcome to [file an issue](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/new). Before you do, please go through this pre-flight checklist:

1. Is the source of the error or problem the RStudio IDE itself? Many errors you see inside RStudio come from R or R packages. If you're having trouble with R, read [Getting Help with R](https://www.r-project.org/help.html) for pointers.

2. Is your issue a bug rather than a question? If you're having general trouble with RStudio or have questions for the RStudio community, the [RStudio Community Forum](https://community.rstudio.com/c/rstudio-ide) is an excellent resource.

3. Are you the first person to report this issue? [Search the issue list](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues) to find out. If you aren't, the most helpful thing you can do is vote for the existing issue (add a reaction to it), and optionally add a comment describing your own experience.

When you're ready to file an issue, please do the following:

1. If at all possible, include a [minimal working example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_Working_Example) which will reproduce the bug. If you're unable to reproduce consistently, then please do your best to provide us a set of actions, or other steps that seem to be correlated with the issue you are seeing. 

2. Indicate your operating system, exact version of RStudio (from *Help | About RStudio*) and the output of `sessionInfo()` in R.

3. If appropriate, include screenshots, any relevant log files, and a [diagnostic report](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200321257-Running-a-Diagnostics-Report).

Label your issue with **bug**. We appreciate you taking the time to file a report; detailed bug reports from the community help us tremendously!

## Enhancements

You're also welcome to submit ideas for enhancements to RStudio. When doing so, please [search the issue list](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been filed. If it has, vote for it (add a reaction to it) and optionally add a comment with your perspective on the idea. 

If you're the first to propose the enhancement, describe it in as much detail as you can, and label your issue with **enhancement**.
